            <h2>Asian Small-Clawed Otters</h2>
            <p>
                The Asian small-clawed otter (Aonyx cinerea) is the smallest of the 13 otter species. Native to Southeast Asia, it ranges from India to the Philippines, Taiwan, and southern China. It lives in freshwater and brackish habitats such as rivers, marshes, and mangroves, and can also adapt to human-made areas like rice paddies and irrigation channels.

                Their paws are highly dexterous, allowing them to use them to forage for prey in murky water or mud. They have stiff whiskers, called "vibrissae," to detect prey movement. They can also close their nostrils and ears to assist with diving.
