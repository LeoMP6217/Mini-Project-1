            <p>
                The Asian small-clawed otter (Aonyx cinerea) is the smallest of the 13 otter species. Native to Southeast Asia, it ranges from India to the Philippines, Taiwan, and southern China. It lives in freshwater and brackish habitats such as rivers, marshes, and mangroves, and can also adapt to human-made areas like rice paddies and irrigation channels.
